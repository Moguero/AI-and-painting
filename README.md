## AI & Painting

### Goal

This project aims at creating from scratch an AI pipeline designed to feed a robot with images and their classification maps, in order to assist a painter in his painting process ðŸŽ¨



### Requirements
Firstly, clone this GitHub repository on your machine.
To install the environment I used for this challenge, you will need a virtual environment manager, for example [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
In your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository and execute the following command line to reproduce the environment used :

```
conda env create -f environment_lin.yml
```

If you're on Linux, use environment_lin.yml file. On Windows, use environment_win.yml.

Once you're done, don't forget to remove the environment by running :

```
conda env remove -n ai-and-painting
```

### Getting started

The `main.py` script should be used for training and predicting.

You can get some help on how to use it with : 
```
python main.py --help
```
It will display you the following help page : 

```
usage: main.py [-h] [--train] [--predict] [--light] [--note] [--patches-limit PATCHES_LIMIT] [--epochs EPOCHS] [--report REPORT] [--data-augment]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --train, -t           Whether to create and train a new model.
  --predict, -pred      Whether to infer predictions on test images. Will ask the user a model path to use.
  --light, -l           Build a light report with image/predictions comparisons only. Should only be used with --predict.
  --note, -n            Add a note to the training report. Should only be used with --train.
  --patches-limit PATCHES_LIMIT, -pl PATCHES_LIMIT
                        Maximum number of patches to use for training. Should only be used with --train.
  --epochs EPOCHS, -e EPOCHS
                        Maximum number of epochs during training. Should only be used with --train.
  --report REPORT, -r REPORT
                        Report path to give the model to make the inference with. Should only be used with --predict.
  --data-augment, -da   Apply data augmentation on the training data. Should only be used with --train.

```

For example, for the training use case : 

```
python main.py --train --note --epochs 10 --data-augment
```

and for the predicting use case :

```
python main.py --predict --report <../training/report/path> --light
```

Note that `--train` and `--predict` options can be
specified at the same time in one command,
so that the predictions are made directly 
on the new trained model.


### Methodology

1. Creation of the dataset.

a. Download labels masks from LabelBox.

The PNG labels masks can be downloaded with the command :

python labelbox_utils/mask_downloader.py --json-path "<path_to_json>" --output-dir-path "<path_to_output_dir>"

b. Merge the masks together

c. Reorganize the masks folder structure.

d. Upload images with masks (images_utils).

e. stack image masks (save_all_categorical_masks)

### Improvements

- track patches used for training with more detail (save used patches number, save minimized images)
- track data augmentation more closely during training
- increase number of unet encoder/decoder blocks
